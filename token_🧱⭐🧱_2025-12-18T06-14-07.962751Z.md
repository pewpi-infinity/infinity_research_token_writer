## Post-numeric symbolic research economies

Hydrogen occupies a unique position in physical reality: it is simultaneously fuel,
information carrier, and structural component. Recent investigative work suggests that
hydrogen-coded energy substitution may replace traditional nuclear fission pathways by
capturing entropy during evaporation phases rather than releasing it destructively.

This research explores how orbital hydrogen states may act as quantum-stable memory,
allowing energy systems to store state information without heat loss. The implications
span energy, computation, and economic modeling, particularly in post-numeric symbolic
economies where value is tied to research density rather than scarcity.
